You can stop the server from the terminal using Ctrl + C and start it using Node directly (node mainEntryFile.js) 
or using a run script in the package.json file with npm run.

For example, the "start": "node server.js" script would be run from the terminal using npm run start.

To implement server auto restarting on file save Node provides the --watch flag you can add to your start script 
"start": "node --watch server.js" or you can install an npm package like nodemon. We will leave this to you as an exercise.

# Start a Working Express Server
One fundamental method is app.listen(port). It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in running state. 
For testing reasons, we need the app to be running in the background so we added this method in the server.js file for you.
