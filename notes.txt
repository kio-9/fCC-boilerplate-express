You can stop the server from the terminal using Ctrl + C and start it using Node directly (node mainEntryFile.js) 
or using a run script in the package.json file with npm run.

For example, the "start": "node server.js" script would be run from the terminal using npm run start.

To implement server auto restarting on file save Node provides the --watch flag you can add to your start script 
"start": "node --watch server.js" or you can install an npm package like nodemon. We will leave this to you as an exercise.
